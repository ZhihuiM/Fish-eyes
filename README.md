# fish-eyes

We collected some algorithms for fish eye image de distortion.  
Including RAPid and some traditional algorithms (checkboard, horizontal expansion, latitude, longitude).

## Folder Structure

'input_images': Put the fisheye images that need to be de distorted in this folder.  
'output_images': Output images of different algorithms will be stored here (corresponding subfolder).
'utils', 'models', 'weight': Files about RAPiD model.  
'Traditional_methods': Four different traditional algorithms.
